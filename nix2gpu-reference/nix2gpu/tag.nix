      The tag to use for your container image.

      This option specifies the tag that will be applied to the container
      image when it is built and pushed to a registry. Tags are used to
      version and identify different builds of your image.

      The default value is "latest", which is a common convention for the most
      recent build. However, it is highly recommended to use more descriptive
      tags for production images, such as version numbers or git commit hashes.
